projects:
  - name: "Music Editing and Collaboration Platform"
    platform: "web"
    stack: "Implemented a React-based web app for music editing and collaboration, incorporating audio effects, filters, masks, and augmented reality. Utilized AWS S3 for cloud storage and Socket.io for real-time messaging, allowing users to collaborate in real-time. Integrated Redux for state management and Stripe for secure payments. Enabled users to collaborate and edit music with various features, enhancing the user experience."
    
  - name: "Face Mask Detector"
    platform: "web"
    stack: "Led the development of a real-time face mask detection system in Python using CNN for high-level image content representation. Designed, trained, and fine-tuned the CNN model, achieving 95% accuracy in detecting face masks in video streams, thereby reducing false positives. The project significantly contributed to safety compliance in public spaces by accurately identifying individuals without masks."
    
  - name: "Apartment Hunter"
    platform: "web"
    stack: "Built a full-stack web application using Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB. The platform aggregates apartment data from multiple websites and offers a centralized search solution for San Jose State University (SJSU) students. Implemented continuous integration and deployment using Jenkins, and the project is containerized with Docker and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring high availability and scalability."

  - name: "SaaS GPT Blogger"
    platform: "web"
    stack: "Constructed a SaaS platform with Next.js 13, React, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and integrated Stripe for Payment. The platform, designed with an intuitive interface, offers User management, Blog Generation, and Blog Management, enabling seamless interaction with artificial intelligence for effortless blog generation."
    
  - name: "E-commerce Cloth Store"
    platform: "web"
    stack: "Developed a high-performance e-commerce application with 13 individual microservices utilizing a Choreography pattern and JSON for inter-service communication. The project saw an incorporation of Apache Kafka for message queuing, improving processing speed by 30%. It is deployed on Docker ensuring 99.99% uptime. Tech Stack includes NodeJS, MySQL, MongoDB Atlas, .NET Core, Apache Kafka, Docker, React.js, jQuery, Postman, Apache Xampp, Git."
    
  - name: "Covid Norms Detection System"
    platform: "web"
    stack: "Developed an accurate detection system using CNN (TensorFlow, Keras, Pretrained ResNet50v2) and a YOLO-based DNN for Face Mask Detection and Social Distancing Tracer, achieving a 98.75% accuracy rate. The system was trained on 10,000 images, providing real-time video analysis capabilities with a processing speed of 150ms per image, enhancing safety compliance in public spaces by identifying mask usage and social distancing violations with 97.8% precision."

  - name: "Cashflow Minimizer"
    platform: "web"
    stack: "An interactive project utilizing HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Binary Heap algorithm to solve complex cash transactions dynamically. It leverages Apache servers for generating dynamic input values and intelligently suggests the most efficient way to resolve transactions, optimizing both space and time and improving overall transaction efficiency."
