projects:
  - name: "Music Editing and Collaboration Platform"
    platform: "web"
    stack: "Implemented a React-based web app for music editing and collaboration, incorporating audio effects, filters, masks, and augmented reality. Utilized AWS S3 for cloud storage and Socket.io for real-time messaging, allowing users to collaborate in real-time. Integrated Redux for state management and Stripe for secure payments. Enabled users to collaborate and edit music with various features, enhancing the user experience."
    
  - name: "Face Mask Detector"
    platform: "web"
    stack: "Led the development of a real-time face mask detection system in Python using CNN for high-level image content representation. Designed, trained, and fine-tuned the CNN model, achieving 95% accuracy in detecting face masks in video streams, thereby reducing false positives. The project significantly contributed to safety compliance in public spaces by accurately identifying individuals without masks."
    
  - name: "Apartment Hunter"
    platform: "web"
    stack: "Built a full-stack web application using Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB. The platform aggregates apartment data from multiple websites and offers a centralized search solution for San Jose State University (SJSU) students. Implemented continuous integration and deployment using Jenkins, and the project is containerized with Docker and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring high availability and scalability."

  - name: "mage Encryption and Decryption CLI"
    platform: "web"
    stack: "Developed a command-line interface (CLI) tool in Node.js for image encryption and decryption using XOR-based encryption. The tool can read input images, generate random encryption keys, apply encryption to pixel data, and securely store keys. It also supports decryption, retrieving keys, and saving decrypted images. This project demonstrates proficiency in cryptography, image processing, and CLI application development."
